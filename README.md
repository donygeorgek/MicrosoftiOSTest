iOS Developer Test for Microsoft

Hi,

I am Dony George. I have completed the iOS Challenge for the Outlook Team and would like it to be reviewed. The test was supposed to be delivered by Dec 13th 2017. I have done this with the limited amount of time I got this weekend. I was too busy with my works last week. The code is also available in GitHub and have invited Ogden and Eddie to the repository.


As for me I have 6 years of experience in iOS development and have worked on both Obj-C and swift projects. The project was written Swift 3.2 on Xcode 8.3.3. No third party libraries were used.

Below is what is done in the project

- The project used Apple MVC. No other design patterns are used
- Implemented a calendar view using collection view.
- Calender has current month, previous month and next month dates.
- Only current month dates are selectable. Today’s date and selected dates are distinguishable.
- Dates with events are marked.
- Tapping on dates with events shows the agenda view
- Events are dynamically created from a predefine dataset included in the app and so it varies everytime
- User location is fetched and the current weather forecast is also shown in the agenda header. Forecast.io is used for api
- Test cases are not written due to my time limitation

I could have added more features like changing months with swipe, better animations even loading sample data from any api etc. I have used the approach which I feel will take the least amount of to develop this.

Awaiting the review comments so that I can know what needs to be improved from my end

Thanks & Regards,
Dony George
